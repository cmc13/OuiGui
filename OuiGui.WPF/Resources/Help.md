# Welcome to OuiGui Chocolatey NuGet!

This application is intended to be a graphical user interface (or Gui, get it? :) ) for the Chocolatey NuGet command-line tool. You can install, update, or remove any applications just like you would with the Chocolatey tool.

# How Do I Use It?

Excellent question! On the left side of the application window, you'll notice a list of the applications available via the Chocolatey package feed. You can click on any of them to view specific details about the package itself. At the bottom of the details pane on the right will also be actions you can take with the package. You can install the package, run any updates if one is available, or uninstall any previously installed programs. There are also helpful search and filter options within the list view, so you can find the applications you need faster. **You can dismiss this help dialog with the left-pointing arrow in the top-right corner of the page**. This dialog will only be shown the first time you run the application, but you can always bring it back with the help button in the title bar.

## Ack! This Isn't Helpful Enough!

I'm sorry about that. I'm a software engineer (read: code monkey) so my communication faculties are limited. If this help dialog failed in its mission to be helpful, please open an issue on the project's Github page (see below) describing what you think is missing and I'll do my best to update this help text and deploy an update.

# Project Information

The project Github page is located at https://github.com/cmc13/OuiGui. You can submit any issues you find there and I'll look into them as I find the time. If you feel strongly compelled to send me a message directly, I can be reached on twitter (@noremaceloc).

## License Information

This application and its source code are licensed by the MIT open source license, which I consider to be fairly unrestrictive. If you find any elements useful, feel free to use them elsewehere.

# What's the Point?

Chocolatey is a command-line tool and a really easy to use one at that, so the need for a graphical user interface is questionable. This was just an idea that I had and wanted to apply some WPF knowledge I had recently acquired. I hope it helps somebody in some way use the chocolatey tool if they are unable or unwilling to use the command line. I tried my best to make the application usable and pretty, despite the obvious handicap that I am a software engineer and am not an expert in usability or graphical design. When I started the project, I was unaware of the existence of the ChocolateyGUI application (another graphical user interface for the Chocolatey command-line tool). I did not copy any code from that project nor did I (intentionally) steal any design elements from the application's user interface. I will freely admit that I modeled some parts of the application after the Chocolatey project page located at http://chocolatey.org/.

# This Application Sucks!

I'm sorry to hear that. As stated previously, this was mostly a labor of love for myself and I'm by no means a rockstar developer. You can submit issues (looking for constructive feedback to improve the application, please) at the aforementioned Github page. Feel free to try the command line (it's really easy) instead.

## It Doesn't Even Work!

I'm very sorry about that. I have limited resources with which to test this application so I can only say that it appeared to work on my PC at the time it was released to the wild (not a very good excuse, I know). I am not aware of any features that might make this application not work in certain Windows environments. If you open an issue on the project Github page with what specifically is happening along with details about your current PC/Windows configuration, I'll see if there's anything I can do about it.

# This Application Rocks!

Thanks :)
